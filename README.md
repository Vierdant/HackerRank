# HackerRank Solutions
Here you will find my go at most of the challenges provided by [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).

## What is HackerRank?
HackerRank is a place where programmers from all over the world come together to solve problems in a wide range of Computer Science domains such as algorithms, machine learning, or artificial intelligence, as well as to practice different programming paradigms like functional programming.

You are also able to undertake a selection of tests provided by HackerRank and get certified on certain subjects.

Althought, that's not always the case.
